## Introduction
‚ÄúThings are hidden ‚Äî in pyramids, in tombs, in sarcophagi. There are false doors. **Even hieroglyphs require a code to understand them**.‚Äù says Jan-Lodewijk Grootaers, MIA‚Äôs curator of African art notes.

The world seems to be very obsessed with ancient Egypt. As one of the earliest human civilizations, their artwork, culture, temples, mummies, and all their unknown secrets have drawn my interest to it since childhood. One of many things that I am really curious about is the hieroglyph (sacred carving). I mean, they use the combination of "bird" and "eye", or even something like "snake" icons to communicate!!!

This draws me to educate myself to learn how to read hieroglyph text and characters. This also sparks my idea to create this project for people that are curious about this topic as well, for people who want to learn hieroglyphs.

Everything starts with a small step, we begin with their basic alphabet that was represented by their wordmarks. Using the most effective method that my mom used to teach me the Mandarin language, "**flashcard**" that promotes studying through active recall, which is one of the practices through which our brains learn most effectively. You will learn all the alphabet in a shuffled way. You can also challenge yourself to recall what you have been learning in the "Guess zone"

The tech stack that I have been using was Figma to design the layout and UI of the app, and code it with SwiftUI.

## Author
Hi, I'm Eric Angelo, an 18 years old self-taught designer with 1+ years experiences in product design industries and specialized in app UI design, and one of the Apple Developer Academy Indonesia Cohort 5 participant. On the first mini challenge, me and my group friends crafted an app called Readify, an app that helps college student to build and maintain their reading habit journey. This submission was my very first time of my life to code on my own using SwiftUI after watching a lot of Swift tutorials on Youtube videos, and of course with the help of StackOverFlow üòÇ.
